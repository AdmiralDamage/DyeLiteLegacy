# DyeLiteLegacy
This repository houses my version of the DyeLite program for Mabinogi.

I got fed up with people moaning about the issues in DyeLite and decided to fix them myself. I did the best I could with a resource editing program, but beyond what is currently done, not much else can be done to save this program. It is for it's original intent and purpose, still 95% functional. This repository will only ever have the most minor fixes done, nothing really functionality wise, probably only the readme or new korean text that I discover.

In the meantime, I am working on a new utility to replace this and others, do not message me about it, it will be out when it is out.
