### Dyelite is not and never will be a "type in the color, get the perfect dye" program. It is only an aid to the process. It was never designed with giving you a 100% chance of getting your dye, in mind. It's purpose is to simply automate the process as arbitrarily as a computer can.

# DyeLiteLegacy
This repository houses my version of the DyeLite program for Mabinogi.

I got fed up with people moaning about the issues in DyeLite and decided to fix them myself. I did the best I could with a resource editing program because the source code has been dead and lost since 2009, around 8 years at the time of writing this message, but beyond what is currently done, not much else can be done to save this program. It is for it's original intent and purpose, still 95% functional. This repository will only ever have the most minor fixes done, nothing really functionality wise, probably only the readme or new korean text that I discover.

In the meantime, I am working on a new utility to replace this and others, do not message me about it, it will be out when it is out.

This is the appearance of the application:

As you can see it is much cleaner than it's older counterpart dubbed the "G12 'English' Version":

Licensing stuff:

The versions of this program produced under my work may not be distributed behind a paywall or adwall. They must only be distributed from this github. It is not allowed for people to collect revenue based on my or the previous authors' work, without them benefitting. It is none of my concern how you pay for your website hosting fees. This is a free tool. You have permission to link to this github and even the release pages. 

Private or personal redistribution (aka sharing between friends over say skype, google drive, etc) is entirely allowed, but only if it is not behind a paywall or adwall such as ad-fly. 

You may not host these files on a public web server such as a forum, link to the release page or this page instead.
